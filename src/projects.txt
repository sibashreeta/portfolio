Research Work: Analyzing the Network Traffic in the Snowflake Bridge of TOR
Technologies Used: Wireshark, Network Traffic Analysis, WebRTC, Protocol Analysis
About the Research:
Conducted an in-depth analysis of the Tor Bridge Snowflake’s network traffic to investigate its obfuscation techniques for bypassing 
censorship. Compared Snowflake traffic patterns with Firefox web browsing and Zoom web meetings using Wireshark. Identified key similarities between 
Snowflake’s obfuscated traffic and WebRTC-based video conferencing, enhancing understanding of its anonymity features. Distinguished Snowflake traffic 
from standard web browsing and native video conferencing by analyzing protocol sequences.
